<div id="1" style="display:none;"><p class="indent">In this project we try to understabd how meta-learning allows machine learning systems to benefit from their repetitive application. If a learning system fails to perform efficiently, one would expect the learning mechanism itself to adapt in case the same task is presented again. Metalearning differs from base-learning in the scope of the level of adaptation; whereas learning at the base-level is focused on accumulating experience on a specific task, learning at the metalevel is concerned with accumulating experience on the performance of multiple applications of a learning system. Briefly stated, the field of metalearning is focused on the relation between tasks or domains, and learning algorithms. Rather than starting afresh on each new task, metalearning facilitates evaluation and comparison of learning algorithms on many different previous tasks, establishes benefits and disadvantages, and then recommends the learning algorithm, or combination of algorithms, that maximizes some utility function on the new task. The utility or usefulness of a given learning algorithm is often determined through a mapping between a characterization of the task and the algorithm estimated performance.</p></div>
