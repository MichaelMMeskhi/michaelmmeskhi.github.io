## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="michael.jpg">

Pronounced 	(*mee k-h ah EEl*). <br>

I am a graduate research assistant at the University of Houston at the [Pattern Analysis Laboratory](https://www.uh.edu/pa-lab/) under [Dr. Ricardo Vilalta](https://www.uh.edu/~rvilalta/)'s supervision. My research is primarily focused on meta-learning and transfer learning in Machine Learning.

Currently on-going projects: Unboxing CNNs via Transfer Learning - Standarizing Experiment Results via OpenML - Meta-learning theory of learning to learn. 

For any questions or collaboration on ongoing or past projects, please see my [Github](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi) page and use the `Create New Issue` option for requests. E-mailing me also works.

1. Vilalta, R., **M.Meskhi, M.**: **[Transfer of Knowledge Across Tasks](TLchapter.pdf)** a chapter pre-print in Metalearning: Applications to Data Mining (2019).

2. Vilalta, R., Dhar Gupta, K., Boumber, D., **M.Meskhi M.**: **[A General Approach to Domain Adaptation with Applications in Astronomy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329884189_A_General_Approach_to_Domain_Adaptation_with_Applications_in_Astronomy)**, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (2018).

## Projects

- **[TEX](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi/TransferLRP/tree/master/lrp)**: Transfer explainability in deep neural networks via layer-wise relevance propagation.
- **[MtL-Progress](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi/MtL-Progress)**: Repo to track the progress in Meta-Learning (MtL) and give an overview of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common MtL problems and research topics. It aims to cover both traditional and core MtL tasks.
