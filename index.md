## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="michael.jpg">

I am a research assistant at the University of Houston at the Pattern Analysis Lab under Dr. Ricardo Vilalta's supervision. My research is primarily focused in Machine Learning and it's subfields. Topics I work on include but are not limited to, Meta-Learning, Domain Adapatation, Topological Data Analysis and Transfer Learning.

Check out my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mikhailmekhedkinmeskhi) for research and life related blog posts!

For any questions or collaboration on ongoing or past projects, please see my [Github](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi) page and use the `Create New Issue` option for requests. E-mailing me also works.
