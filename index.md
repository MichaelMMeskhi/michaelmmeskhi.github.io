## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="michael.jpg">

Pronounced 	(*mee k-h ah EEl*). <br>

I am a research assistant at the University of Houston at the Pattern Analysis Lab under Dr. Ricardo Vilalta's supervision. My research is primarily focused on meta-learning and transfer learning in Machine Learning.

Currently on-going projects: Unboxing CNNs via Transfer Learning - Standarizing Experiment Results via OpenML - Meta-learning theory of learning to learn. 

Check out my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mikhailmekhedkinmeskhi) for research and life related blog posts!

For any questions or collaboration on ongoing or past projects, please see my [Github](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi) page and use the `Create New Issue` option for requests. E-mailing me also works.

## Publications

1. Vilalta, R., Dhar Gupta, K., Boumber, Dainis., **Meskhi M.**: **[A General Approach to Domain Adaptation with Applications in Astronomy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329884189_A_General_Approach_to_Domain_Adaptation_with_Applications_in_Astronomy)**, Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.

## Projects

- **[MtL-Progress](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi/MtL-Progress)**: Repo to track the progress in Meta-Learning (MtL) and give an overview of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) across the most common MtL problems and research topics. It aims to cover both traditional and core MtL tasks.
- **[OpenML-Python](https://github.com/openml/openml-python)**: Python module to interface with OpenML.org.
- **[transferAL](https://github.com/PAL-UH/transferAL)**: Proposed a new bayesian algorithm with promising results on supervised and unsupervised astronomy problems.


## Talks & Teachings

- **\[May 2019]**: [Introduction to Learning to Learn](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi/MtL-Progress/blob/master/resources/files/intro_learning_to_learn.pdf) at the [Houston Machine Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Machine-Learning/events/261384583/)

- **\[March 2019]**: [Meta-Transfer Learning](https://medium.com/@mikhailmekhedkinmeskhi/meta-transfer-learning-6a02160ddaad)
