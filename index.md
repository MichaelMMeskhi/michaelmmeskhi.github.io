## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="michael.jpg">

Welcome to my page:

I am a senior year student at North American University working on my B.S. in Computer Science in Houston, Texas. 

> "The aim of education is the knowledge not of facts but of values." - William Ralph Inge

## Research Interest

My research is primarily focused in Machine Learning and it's subfields. Topics I work on include but are not limited to, Meta-Learning, Domain Adapatation, Topological Data Analysis and Statistical Learning.

For any questions or collaboration on ongoing or past projects, please see my [Github](https://github.com/MichaelMMeskhi) page and use the `Create New Issue` option for requests. E-mailing me also works.
