# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence has been around us for thousands of years. Evolving decade to decade we have seen birth to new axioms or as I like to call them "concepts of understanding the universe". Such concepts are logic, mathematics, and computer science. These three fields encompass far more fields that make up the world we around us. Let's start discussing 
these concepts and how important they are for us.

## Logic

Logic is something that helps up deduce results from given information. Such as if event A is true and event B is true thus according to Aristotle event C must be true! The contents of the events do not matter but the logical form. Logic is the key foundation to computer science. We use logic in everyday life so do computers. 

## Mathematics

Math has been the key to the universe. It is the so called universal language that we use to communicate our thoughts and understanding to better explain the occurances that happen in this mystical world. Artificial Intelligence heavily relies on mathematics. Linear algebra, Calculus, and Discrete math are in its core that form a strong bond. 

## Computer Science

Computer science is what brings logic and mathematics to a whole new level. They are both the founders of computer science and are both the most important ingridients that help us create innovative next level products and solutions to everyday problems. In my blog I will be discussing my adventures in Artificial Intelligence and the experience my lab and I receive from these wonderful topics.
