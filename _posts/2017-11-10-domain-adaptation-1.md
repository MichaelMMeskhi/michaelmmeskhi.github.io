What is Domain Adaptation?
======

Domain Adaptation is a field associated with machine learning and transfer learning. This scenario arises when we aim at learning from a source data distribution a well performing model on a different (but related) target data distribution. For instance, one of the tasks of the common spam filtering problem consists in adapting a model from one user (the source distribution) to a new one who receives significantly different emails (the target distribution). Note that, when more than one source distribution is available the problem is referred to as multi-source domain adaptation.
